# Mongo to Postgres Connector

**NOTE: this connector is incomplete and requires more work.**

## Description

A connector, built on
[Mongo Connector](https://github.com/mongodb-labs/mongo-connector),
to migrate data from Mongo to Postgres.

For each specified collection, you must create the following schema in Postgres:

    create table [TABLE] (id string PRIMARY KEY, data jsonb)
    create index [TABLE]_data_gin on [TABLE] using GIN (data)

Where `[TABLE]` is the Mongo collection name all in lowercase. 

E.g. for the collection `audit.accountHistory` you need to create a table called `accounthistory` and an index `accounthistory_jdoc_gin`.

## Running

Create a
[config.json](https://github.com/mongodb-labs/mongo-connector/wiki/Configuration-Options)
file like:

    {
        "mainAddress": "localhost:27017",
        "docManagers": [
            {
                "docManager": "postgresql_jsonb_manager",
                "targetURL": "postgresql://localhost:5432/dms",
                "args": { "mongoUrl": "localhost:27017" }
            }
        ]
    }

There are lots of additional options but the ones here are the bare
minimum.

Then run:

     mongo-connector -c config.json

## Testing and local development

* Ensure you have `docker` installed. 
* Run `build.sh` to execute unit and integration tests.
* To manually execute unit tests run `python3 setup.py test` 
    
## What is a 'DocManager'

Mongo Connector uses a doc manager to manage replication. Our one
writes Mongo records to Postgres in a jsonb format.

You can read more about what a doc manager is here:

https://github.com/mongodb-labs/mongo-connector/wiki/Writing-Your-Own-DocManager

But essentially, the steps are, create these files:

    docman_project/mongo_connector/__init__.py
    docman_project/mongo_connector/doc_managers/__init__.py
    docman_project/mongo_connector/doc_managers/your_custom_doc_manager.py

The __init__ files tells Python the directory contains a package so it
looks for files in the directory.

The `your_custom_doc_manager.py` file is where your plugin will live.

Then define a class in `your_custom_doc_manager.py` that extends
DocManagerBase and implements a variety of methods around replication
events (the docs describe these in more detail).

Once done, you can test your doc manager. To do this, you'll need to
add you local files to your Python path. Pipenv can help here:

    pipenv shell

From here, assuming you've already pipenv installed things, you can
run mongo-connector as normal:

    mongo-connector -c config.json

Only now, it will use your local files!file for the source etc.
